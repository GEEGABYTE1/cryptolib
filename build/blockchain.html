                                                        <a>
                                                            Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology (i.e., Bitcoin networks), all activity on the network can be transparently <br>
                                                            viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occuring live. <br>
                                                            Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. <br>
                                                        </a><br>
                                                        <h2><strong>Security of Blockchain</strong></h2>
                                                        <a>
                                                            New blocks on the blockchain are always stored linearly and chronologically. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, <br>
                                                            it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of the network has reached consensus to do so. <br>
                                                            This is mostly because each block contains <em>it's own hash</em>, along with the <em> hash of the block </em> before it and the previously mentioned time stamp. <br>
        
                                                        </a>

                                                            <em> For example </em>, let's say a hacker who is apart of the blockchain network wants to change the blockchain and steal some cryptocurrency. If they were to change their own node,
                                                            it would no longer match everyone else's copy. Thus, when everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see the one changed copy stand out, which would be seen as illegitimate. <br>
                                            
                                                        </a>
                                                        <a> It is relatively difficult for a hacker to succeed in a such task in the first place. It requires 51% of more of the nodes altered, which would take lost of materials and energy beacuse they would each
                                                        have different time stamps and hashes.</a><br><br>

                                                                However, none of them have been able to create an efficient solution until blockchain came along in our lives. <br>
