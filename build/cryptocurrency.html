                                                        <h2> What is Cryptocurrency Mining?</h2><br>
                                                        <m> Billions of dollars' worth transactions take place on cryptocurrency networks, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and more each day. <br>
                                                            These transactions are grouped together and rolled into, "blocks", which get appended to a <u>chain</u> of blocks that go all 
                                                            the way back to the Genesis block (the first transaction ever made).<br>

                                                        </m><br>
                                                        <m> Although blockchains may seem like automatic processes that runs on it's own, there are still some manual configurations that are being made.<br>
                                                            One of the most common ones include <strong>Mining</strong>. People that run complex softwares (which are called miners) race to validate the transactions
                                                            that occur on the chain by completing complex algorithmic puzzles. These complex algorithmic puzzles are almost impossible to solve by hand, and takes immense 
                                                            energy from the computer to solve, which is why blockchain is super secure in the first place. <br>
                                            
                                                        </m><br>
                                                        <m> However, if users do find away to solve the puzzle, they get rewarded of minted coins, that miners can keep to trade for some fiat value. 
                                                            It should be noted though, although it's a complex and resource-heavy process, it's a big business. According to <a href="http://Digiconomist.com" target="_blank">Digiconomist.com, </a>
                                                            Bitcoin mining alone generates almost an astonishing amount of $6 billion a year.
                                                        </m><br>

                                                        <m> There have been many successful cases of users finding a solution to such algorithmic puzzles, which have inspired more people to follow suit and buy 
                                                            gaming-intensive graphics cards to start running mining processes on their machines. However, the more miners present, the more computationally intensive
                                                            the mining process on the network gets. This in turn can only be handled by powerful mining computers, which take a lot of energy.<br><br>
                                                            For example, we can study Bitcoin's mining consumption is comparable to the power consumption of Austria as a whole.
                                                            How is this possible you may ask? Bitcoin mining in context requires twice the energy than mining the same value of copper, gold, or platnium. 
                                                            More specifically, one dollar's worth of bitcoin takes about <u>19 megajoules</u> of energy to mine, compared to <u>4</u> or <u>5</u>, and <u>6</u> megajoules
                                                            for copper gold, and platnium.<br>
                                                            Other cryptocurrencies also do fairly poor in comparision. According to Nature Sustainability, a cost-per-dollar for Ethereum only takes 9 megajoules and 14 megajoules for the 
                                                            privacy focused cryptocurrency. </m>

                                                            is equivalent to that of the nation of Ireland. Another estimate was equivalent to the

                                                        <m> According to Guardian, any cryptocurrency mined in China would generate
                                                            four times the amount of CO2 compared to the amount generated in Canada.

                                                        <m> Cryptocurrencies are legal in most places, but regulators are having 
                                                            difficulties tracking crypto activity. For example, the United States'
                                                            Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly said Bitcoin - and other 
                                                            cryptocurrencies are not securities.
                                                        </m><br>
                                                        <m> However, something to pay attention to is the laws around exchange apps
                                                            (large platforms where you can buy and sell digital currencies, such as Crypto.com or Coinbase).
                                                        </m>
                                                        <m>This is due to 99% of cryptocurrency trading happening on exchange apps, and most people
                                                            withdraw money to fiat values right through the platform itself.
                                                        </m><br>
                                                        <m>
                                                            Along with exchange apps, cryptocurrencies themselves also struggle with nation-state laws. 
                                                            For instance, Binance, a major crypto-exchange for the world, based in Malta, lists around
                                                            550 coins all trying to become bigger than Bitcoin, however, American Output only lists 31 coins out
                                                            out of the 550. This is the reason why there is a Binance and Binance.usd.

                                                            because they believe in the market. Most of these tokens aren't actually backed by 
                                                            fiat-currencies. However, if people believe they're worth something, then, they are.

                                                            It's all about taking risks.

                                                            In 2020, the revenue from all NFT marketplaces (OpenSea, rarible, and etc) for the entire year was 
                                                            $250 million. As of October 24th, 2021, more than 470,000 unique blockchain wallet addresses transacted 
                                                            in the last 30 days on the top five marketplaces.

                                                        <m>The reason why NFTs have so much hype is beacuse they can establish a real value for digital content by creating 
                                                            and enforcing true scarcity. NFTs can identify the source of the digital asset, create a finite number of replicas, and uniquely track 
                                                            each replica. Any app can see that creation data and confirm the finite number of replicas created by referencing the transaction 
                                                            that recorded their creation of a blockchain network.

                                                            NFTs also solves the Secondary Sales dilemma, where in third-party sellers have 
                                                            been able to capitalize on seeling products and content at the expense of the original content creators.

                                                            To summarize, NFTs essentially bridge content domains with crypto markets, creating the foundation for a robust creator economy!
