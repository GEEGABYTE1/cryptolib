                                                                This is due to the possible detrminental situation of the companies, when they do not have access to financial firms to obtain 
                                                                funding for innovating leading to competitive disadvantages. As a result, there is less of a support of the local economy since there are 
                                                                less jobs, salaries, and tax volume.

                                                                must often be exchanged to more wide-spread fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, and then must be converted again into
